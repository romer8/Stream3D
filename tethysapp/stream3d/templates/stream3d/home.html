    <h1>Stream3D</h1>
    <p> This is an app that is designed to use hydrologycal data in oder to do forecast about the different streams around the world. The data ythat can be displayed
    for each one of the reaches of a river are Forecast, historical data, and flow direction curve. This data is retrieve in the form of a graph from the GEOGLOWS Streamflow
    Services API. The API retrieves the data, and a javascript library was created to customized this three graphs, so it will be easier to put the three different graphs in popup
   or any other container inside a web application. In addition, data from the World Resources Institute (WRI) is retrieve as a Hydroshare reosurce, so it can be easily acccessed as a service. The name of
   this data set is" Aqueduct Global Flood Risk Maps", and it  provide current and future river flood risk estimates in urban damage, affected GDP, and affected population by country, river basin, and state.
   The datasets in these maps include current and future river flood risk estimates in urban damage, affected GDP, and affected population by country, river basin, and state. Therefore, the Stream3D applciation
   provides data from the GEOGLOWS Streamflow Services API and from the WRI foundation to retrieve forecast and also data about the influence of a flood in urban areas, population and GDP</p>
   <h3> Component of the Stream3D</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>GEOGLOWS Streamflow Services API</li>
     <p> The data used from the API will be used to retrieve forecast, historical, and flow curve data, and it will be proccessed into a CDN javascript library, so it will
     be easy to jsut graph the current forecast of a given stream if the id of the stream reach is given. Three graphs will be given for forecast, historical, and flow rate curve, respectively
     as a result, implementations for graphs a pie chart containing a distribution of the different return periods in the reach of teh stream can be also created for future work.
   </p>
     <li> Aqueduct Global Flood Risk Maps WRI Data Set</li>
     <p>
       The data of the WRI contains two different values: one of the current scenario and another for future projections. Each one of these scenarios gives information about the
       urban damage, affected GDP, and affectefd population taking into account two important factors: socio-economic change and climate change. In other words, the dataset helps to Visualize
       the affected urban area, GDP, and population, and it also gives the percentage of the damage that is part of socio-econmic or climate change factors.

          <p>The app lets the user to choose the different countries using a search bar or a dropdown menu according to the
          preference of the user, so the map can be center in selected country. After the map is zoom and center ina country
          the following can be done:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Stream Return Period Animation </li>
            <p>The app shows the different streams from the world and it can be animated to show how does the different streams
              forecast change with time as time goes forward.The different colors of the animation represent the return periods:
              Yellow(20 yr), Orange(50 yr), and Red (100 yr). In addition, the app can be manually animated with the slide bar, that is on
              bottom of the map. Finally, it can be stopp it any time during the animation with the stop button.
            </p>
            <li>Hydrological, urban damage, affected GDP, and affected population Data </li>
            <p>
              The app is also able to show graphs for the forecast, historical and flow rate curve for the different reaches of a given stream
              by clicking on a reach. The app will display the data using a graphing library. In addition, data will dsiplay the data given by the
              Aquaduct GLobal Flood Risk Map of the World Reource Institute(WRI). This data can be visualized, so the percetages of how the climate
              change and socioeconomic factors influence the urban damage, GDP, and population of the given country.
